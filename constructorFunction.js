    ##### the Prototype Chain
source: www.freecodecamp.org
    All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, 
an objectâ€™s prototype itself is an object.
    Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! 
In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype.
    Therefore, if I recall the hasOwnProperty method, which is defined in Object.prototype, 
which can be accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then be accessed by duck. This is an example 
of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, Bird is the supertype for duck, while duck is the subtype.
Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. 
Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.
